# Profile

I'm Nik Jmaeff; it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm fresh out of school and motivated to join a Developer team. I am great at finding creative but realistic solutions and can also lead if needed. During my Full-Stack Developer Program, I was a peer tutor and even taught the class a few times. 

I have a robust technical foundation supported by several years of work in IT. This foundation makes it easier for me to have technical conversations with other core teams, service integration, and debugging.

I'd love an opportunity to discuss any open positions or hear any suggestions for getting my foot in the door.
